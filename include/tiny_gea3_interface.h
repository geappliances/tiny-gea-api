 * @brief
 *
 * This component is interrupt-aware and handles byte transmit/receive in the
 * interrupt context. Publication of messages is done via a background task in
 * tiny_gea3_interface_run() so the application does not have to do
 * anything special.
 *
 * This component queues sent packets into the provided send queue buffer. If a
 * packet is being sent when another send is requested, the packet will be placed
 * into the queue provided there is sufficient space.
